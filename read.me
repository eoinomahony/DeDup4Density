This is an attempt to work on the residential density of four EU capitals, Dublin, Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Brussels. I have made a new attribute in the attached sample acalled Value.
I would like to sum these values based on the ObjectID attribute to enure that a Land Use Area's Values are aggregated thus ensuring that these LU Areas are accurately represented numerically.
